# About me
I graduated from [SHENYUAN Honors College of Beihang University](http://sae.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm)(北京航空航天大学沈元荣誉学院)and am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University](http://dept3.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm) (北京航空航天大学自动化科学与电气工程学院). My research focuses on software testing and deep learning, which is becoming increasingly urgent and necessary due to the wide application of deep learning software. If you have any ideas on this topic, please feel free to contact me.

My research interests include partition testing, metamorphic testing, and their application to reinforcement learning. I have published more than 3 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=zTz-1d0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MaxwelsDonc/MaxwelsDonc.github.io@google-scholar-stats/gs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> in top international journals such as [TR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=24), [SQJ](https://www.springer.com/journal/11219), which have received numerous citations. 

To promote communication and collaboration among those working on reinforcement learning testing methods, I would like to found a community. If you are interested in joining us, please do not hesitate to contact me!
